# shipdriver\_pi README

A plugin for OpenCPN. Almost a simulator or is it a game?

More user info: https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/plugins/shipdriver.html

Building is documented in INSTALL.md

The plugin uses a continous integration setup described in the
[wiki](https://github.com/Rasbats/managed_plugins/wiki/Alternative-Workflow)
This setup is also able to push all updated metadata files to a clone
of https://github.com/OpenCPN/plugins in order to simplify pull requests
against this site.
