# Given a Flatpak manifest path, configure a new manifest in CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.
# Return path to the configured manifest in ${new_manifest_path}
#
# When configuring, process the tokens @plugin_name, @app_id and @include.
#
# @plugin_name is replaced with the PLUGIN_API_NAME value from Plugin.cmake,
# converted to lowercase. This is expected to be used in the id: line,
# allowing for generic manifests without dependencies.
#
# @app_id is replaced with the base part of the id: line, possibly after
# substituting @plugin_name. The part after the last dot is used. This is
# used as installation prefix in generic library snippets .
#
# @include are expected in lines like:
#
#     - @include opencpn-libs/flatpak/glu.yaml
#
# Copy the contents of the filename mentioned after @include into the new
# manifest.
#  - Filename is relative to the project top-level directory.
#  - The line with @include must start with a '-'.
#  - The included file must have a hyphen ('-') at column 0 in the first
#    non-comment line.
#  - The indentation of the '-' char is added to each line in the included
#    file.
